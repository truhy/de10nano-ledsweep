# Ledsweep for the Terasic DE10-Nano development board

## Overview

Software and logic design that demonstrates the processor system (HPS) working with FPGA logic for the DE10-Nano development board.

This animates the 8x FPGA LEDs (0 to 7) by sweeping them side to side.  Depressing the FPGA tactile keys (0 and 1) increases and decreases the animation speed.

The correct run order is:
1. configure the FPGA first using the bitstream file ledsweep.sof or ledsweep.rbf
2. and then execute this program

Contains HPS software and FPGA hardware design projects.
