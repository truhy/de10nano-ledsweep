# Ledsweep hardware design for the Terasic DE10-Nano development board

## Overview

FPGA logic design demonstrating two-way interaction between the two separate systems: FPGA and HPS.
		
This is the FPGA logic part of the ledsweep, designed to work with the software counterpart.  It provides the logic to support the software on the HPS so that it is able to control the 8x FPGA LEDs, and to receive interrupt that is triggered by the FPGA input keys 0 and 1.

## Project type

A Quartus Prime 23.1std.0.991 Lite Edition project.
